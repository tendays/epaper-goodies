# ePaper goodies

This repository contains an application to render widgets on an ePaper
display, gathering information from various data sources such as:

* The current date / time, both Gregorian and Chinese calendars
* CalDAV or Google calendars
* Weather forecast
* Public transport schedules
* RSS feeds
* HTTP endpoints serving raw text
* Local file system (images and text)
* and more!

The widgets to render are parametrised in a simple text file specifying
coordinates of widgets and data sources.

The application does not interact with the ePaper display directly.
It will instead produce an image file which you should then pass to a
suitable script to show on the ePaper display.

## Server Mode

If you are a lucky owner of a [Watchy smartwatch](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/),
the application can also act as a middleware serving JSON data over
HTTP, which you can then render on the watch.
